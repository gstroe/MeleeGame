Holmfirth is a place of terrible political unrest at the moment. Much of the population is split on the magic issue. Magic has been a common part of life for many generations now and many people living in holmfirt live and rely on magic. Others have grown to resent it, blaming much of the problems of the world on rapid increase usage in magic and beleive that it needs to be controled and heavlily regulated. Some propose that the military should take complete ownership of all magical items and users to  keep them safe from the public and the public safe for them. Others also believe that the mage tower could be used to contain them. Opponents to these ideas see this as an attack on personal freedom and a punishment of the group because of the actions of individual. Many of these people argue this goes against ones right to free will.

Holmfirm is a massive city in the south side of the then Maroon Isles, Those Isles are run by the King of the the Kingdom, Xavier Ambrose. It is modeled after London and the marron Isles are all together about as large as Ireland. The town is bustling with inovations and merchents trying to make there way in this world, most of them still struggling to get by though. The port is probably the largest seen by any PC except for Juldak. Protestors and Counter protestors exist all over the city. Non of them have gone violent... yet...
